\usage{
construct_master_dataframe(
  variable.details.df,
  blinded = "y",
  id_cols = c("screening", "event_name", "event_id"),
  name.of.visit.df = "visit_completion",
  name.of.screening.df,
  number.arms = N.Arms,
  field.description.df = fields
)
}
\arguments{
\item{variable.details.df}{(data frame) should be the data frame in the
Inputs folder. An example can be seen in the template folder.}

\item{blinded}{(character) This should be y or n}

\item{id_cols}{(vector) the names of the id columns as a character vector.
Default is `c("screening", "event_name", "event_id")`.}

\item{name.of.visit.df}{(string) This is the name of the PROSPECT csv
file which contains the details of all visits. In some
trials, this is `"visit_completion"` or `"events"`. Default is
`"visit_completion"`.}

\item{name.of.screening.df}{(string) This is the name of the PROSPECT csv
file which contains the details of all participants screened. In some
trials, this is the "identification_log" or simply "screening_log".}

\item{number.arms}{(integer) the number of arms in the trial.}

\item{field.description.df}{(data frame) the data frame containing the field
labels. Default is `fields`, this is often read in from Fields.csv.}
}
\value{
(data frame) master data frame to be used for analyses or as a basis
 for sharing
}
\description{
`construct_master_dataframe` returns a master data frame which can be used
  for primary analyses, or as a base dataset for sharing.
}
\details{
From the dataframes read in by Read-data.R, this function will produce a
  dataframe of all participants (from screening onwards) with the
  corresponding variables as specified in
  Inputs/AnalysisVariablesDetails.xlsx.

   Any constant characteristics for each participant will be displayed in its
   own column, for example: sex, ethnicity.

  Any date variables will need to be manipulated if another format other than
  the PROSPECT format is needed.

  Adverse events will also be included to this dataset (if specified within
  the input xlsx)

  If blinded='y', a dummy randomisation will be implemented. If blinded='n',
  the randomisation allocation will be taken from PROSPECT.

  If there are duplicate variable names, the df names will be appended to
  them e.g. variable.dfname
}
